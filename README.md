# ext_key
## do not use it now - only test and give feedback :grinning:

This extension is only a skeleton.
It provides the minimal stuff, directories, files (in my opinion) for a minimal TYPO3 extension.
Provides custom frontend plugin with flexform options/fields.
Has a list and a show/detail Method / FLUID Template.

### Installation
... like any other TYPO3 extension [extensions.typo3.org](https://extensions.typo3.org/ "TYPO3 Extension Repository")
Don't forget to include the PageTS -> backend->rootPage->site configuration->resources!
